	<p><em>Mortal Kombat 1 (2023)</em> is a fighting game created by NetherRealm Studios and published by Warner Bros. Games. The game was released on September 19, 2023 for multiple platforms, including the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Windows, and Nintendo Switch. It serves as a reboot of the <em>Mortal Kombat</em> series and also a sequel to <em>Mortal Kombat 11 (2019)</em>.</p>

	<p>One of the main features of <em>Mortal Kombat 1</em> is the <strong>Kameo Fighters</strong> system. Kameo Fighters are characters that offer support to the player throughout the match.<!-- Visit the <a href="#">Kameo Fighters</a> page to learn more.--></p>

<h2>Selecting a Character</h2>

<div>
	<p>To get started, you should decide on a character to play as. Focusing on a single character and learning all of their ins and outs is highly recommended. In general, individuals choose a character based on personal preference and who they like the most. This could be due to the character's physical appearance, their gameplay, their in-game lore, or various other reasons.</p>

	<p>Another consideration when it comes to picking a character is how strong that character is in a competitive setting. A character classified as high tier stands a greater chance of winning compared to those in lower tiers. Usually, looking at tier lists created by competitive players can provide insight into the strength of each character, though these tend to be subjective and can change over time. You can also view carefully thought-out stats for each character on the <a href="/characters/">Characters</a> page or their respective character pages.</p>

<h2>Selecting a Kameo</h2>

<div>
	<p>Choosing a Kameo fighter can be a bit more complicated. While you can pick a Kameo based on likeability, that Kameo might not pair well with the main character you've chosen. A Kameo whose moves complement your character will be much more rewarding than a Kameo that rarely provides any support. This is typically what is known as <strong>synergy</strong>. For example, a character like <a href="/characters/li-mei/">Li Mei</a> has somewhat low combo potential on her own, but when paired with a Kameo such as <a href="/kameos/scorpion/">Scorpion</a>, she can net huge damage output due to his ability to extend combos. Understanding how each Kameo fighter works and what they can offer when combined with your main character is extremely important when deciding on which Kameo to use.<!-- To read more on Kameo fighters, visit the <a href="#">Kameos</a> page.--></p>
