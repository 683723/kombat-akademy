<h1>Controls</h1>

<div>
	<p>Configuring the controls will help when inputting buttons and performing combos. Making sure that you have the right button layout and settings will allow you to execute your moves at a comfortable level without worrying about accidental inputs. By default, the controls are mapped as follows:</p>

	<img alt="Controls" src="/images/guides/controls.jpg" />

	<p>The default button layout is sufficient for most players. There isn't a need to change it unless you prefer an alternative configuration. To try out other layouts, enter the game's Practice Mode and experiment with different control settings until you find one that you're comfortable with. After selecting a button layout, you'll want to familiarize yourself with each button and what they do.</p>

	<div class="tip">If using a controller with trigger buttons, consider assigning Block to one of the top shoulder buttons. This can be beneficial as it takes slightly longer to press and release the trigger than it does for a normal shoulder button. As a result, this allows you to enter and come out of block quicker, and reduces the likelihood of accidentally performing an Up Block when trying to jump after blocking.</div>

	<p><strong>Input Window Timing</strong> - This changes the amount of time given for inputting Special Moves. There are three options to choose from: Short, Medium, and Long. The default option "Long" works well for most players, although some may prefer a shorter input window to avoid getting accidental Special Moves. Setting this option to "Short" could also be problematic as it may not provide enough time to input a Special Move. "Medium" serves as a nice balance between the other two options.</p>
	<p><strong>Release Check</strong> - This setting determines whether Special Moves should be performed on button release. This is also what's known as "Negative Edge". Normally, Special Moves are executed only after pressing down on the required buttons. Turning this setting on allows Special Moves to activate upon pressing down on the required buttons and after releasing them.</p>
	<p>To give an idea of how Release Check works, when trying to input <a href="/characters/reptile/">Reptile's</a> <span class="inputs">B+3,1 DF3</span>, if <span class="inputs">1</span> has been pressed and released before the final <span class="inputs">3</span> has been pressed, the game will register this as <a href="/characters/reptile/">Reptile's</a> Acid Spit (<span class="inputs">DF1</span>) instead of his Force Ball (<span class="inputs">DF3</span>). Therefore, most players prefer to turn Release Check off to prevent unintentional Special Moves.</p>
	<p><strong>Alternate Kontrols</strong> - This affects whether Special Moves require diagonal inputs. If this setting is turned on, Special Moves must have a diagonal input between each directional input. For example, <a href="/characters/sub-zero/">Sub-Zero's</a> Deadly Vapors move must be input as <span class="inputs">D D+F F 4</span> rather than <span class="inputs">DF4</span>. Leaving this setting off is usually preferred since directional inputs may not be recognized at times.</p>
	<p>However, some players may prefer to turn this on as it can help in situations where they previously input a direction and want to follow up with a normal attack without executing a Special Move. Using <a href="/characters/raiden/">Raiden</a> as an example, in certain scenarios you may want to backdash and follow up with his <span class="inputs">F+3,4</span>, but if done too quickly and Alternate Kontrols are off, it will result in <a href="/characters/raiden/">Raiden</a> doing his Electric Fly (<span class="inputs">BF3</span>) move.</p>
	<p><strong>Input Shortcuts</strong> - This toggles whether Special Moves require less directional precision. If this setting is on, Special Moves do not need the full directional inputs in order to be performed. For instance, when using <a href="/characters/johnny-cage/">Johnny Cage's</a> Rising Star (<span class="inputs">DB3</span>), it can be input as <span class="inputs">D D+B 3</span> without having to input <span class="inputs">B</span> on its own. This may help if you sometimes aren't able to execute your Special Moves, however some players might want to turn this off if they prefer to cleanly input their Special Moves.</p>
	<p><strong>Button Shortcuts</strong> - This setting allows certain single-button moves to also be input with multiple buttons. Throws, for example, can be done by pressing the <span class="inputs">THROW</span> button, as well as <span class="inputs">1+3</span>. One thing to note is that the game will also register a throw even if <span class="inputs">1</span> and <span class="inputs">3</span> are not pressed simultaneously which can cause the player to perform unintentional throws. For this reason, some players prefer to keep this setting off.</p>
	<p><strong>Vibration</strong> - This toggles vibration for wireless controllers. Some players may prefer vibration as it helps with immersion, while others may find it disruptive.</p>
