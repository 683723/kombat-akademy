		<p>Hi! My name is Raptor. I am a fighting game enthusiast, former tournament player, and software developer. I've been playing fighting games for many years, most notably the <em>Mortal Kombat</em> and <em>Injustice</em> games by NetherRealm Studios. Since then, I've learned a great deal about how to play these games and playing them at a competitive level. Kombat Akademy is a website aimed towards helping all players improve at fighting games and is meant to serve as a useful resource for the latest NetherRealm Studios titles. I created this website as a passion project of mine and work on it during my free time as a fun hobby so I hope that you'll find this site to be helpful. Thanks.</p>
